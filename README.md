# Canned Food

This mod introduces a variety of canned foods to add some pleasant variety into the available
assrtment of foods and item uses. It relies on the glass bottle from the default vessels mod,
giving this otherwise little used item a considerable purpose.

All products are defined by shapless recipes, and yield items which can be placed in the
real world. Although the cans with non-symmetrical items on labels look good only from
half of the angles.

The recipes follow the scheme of "glass bottle" + "produce" [ + "sugar" ]

The default 4 items do not require sugar, even though 3 of those are jams and probably 
would taste horribly IRL without sugar:
* Apple jam
* Canned brown mushrooms
* Rose petal jam
* Dandelion jam

This is to guarantee that they will always be available in vanilla game. As you can notice,
canning also turns two othwerise inedible objects into food.

Ethereal and farming (redo) mods introduce items that can be canned, too. 
Some of them (jams) require sugar as the third ingredient. So some of them require both mods.

The mason jars with canned food can be put into vessel storage shelves. Or put on display 
just like the glass vessels can, and destroyed by hand (retreiving the item).

The benefit of canning the food is higher nutritional value (since shelf life is irrelevant
in minetest game, where food never goes bad), this is a "reward" for going through effort
to obtain the glass vessels. When the contents of the jasr are consumed, 
the player is left with an empty glass bottle which can be reused.
